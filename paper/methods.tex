\subsection{Multiresolution Analysis}
Solving time independent Schr\"odinger equation for electronic structure theory using atom-centred basis sets lead to complications and sometimes unsatisfactory results in field inclusive environments.  
And in the environments with extreme magnetic it is very vital to check the quality of the
