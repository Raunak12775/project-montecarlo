  abstract = {We present the structure of the H3 molecule (both quartet and doublet state) in the presence of strong magnetic fields of up to 5‚Ñè/(ea20), equivalent to 1.175 MT. Both systems are stable molecules, adopting a triangular structure above about 1‚Ñè/(ea20), but are oriented differently with respect to the magnetic field axis. For computing the molecular structure we implemented the unrestricted Hartree-Fock method including a strong magnetic field in the Hamiltonian. Using multiresolution analysis for the representation of the wave function the basis-set error is reduced to microhartree accuracy, giving rise to essentially gauge-origin-invariant molecular energies and properties. The method is applicable to general molecules of any structure and orientation with respect to the magnetic field axis. Nuclear gradients and current densities are readily available.},

  abstract = {Elementary chemistry distinguishes two kinds of strong bonds between atoms in molecules: the covalent bond, where bonding arises from valence electron pairs shared between neighboring atoms, and the ionic bond, where transfer of electrons from one atom to another leads to Coulombic attraction between the resulting ions. We present a third, distinct bonding mechanism: perpendicular paramagnetic bonding, generated by the stabilization of antibonding orbitals in their perpendicular orientation relative to an external magnetic field. In strong fields such as those present in the atmospheres of white dwarfs (on the order of 105 teslas) and other stellar objects, our calculations suggest that this mechanism underlies the strong bonding of H2 in the  Œ£ 3 + ùë¢ ( 1ùúé ùëî 1 ùúé ‚àó ùë¢ ) Œ£3u+(1œÉg1œÉu*)  triplet state and of He2 in the  ùõ¥ 1 + g (1 ùúé 2 g 1 ùúé *2 u ) Œ£1g+(1œÉg21œÉu*2)  singlet state, as well as their preferred perpendicular orientation in the external field.},

  abstract = {In this perspective, the theoretical treatment of atoms and molecules in strong magnetic fields is discussed. As this is a rather unexplored field, accurate predictions from theory are essential. This is particularly important in the context of astrophysics for the interpretation of observational spectra from white-dwarf stars that can exhibit magnetic fields up to about 1 B0 ( 235,000 T). A theoretical treatment beyond the pertubation limit requires methods that can deal with finite magnetic fields. Results obtained using coupled cluster (CC) as well as equation-of-motion CC theory are presented with a focus on a discussion of the so-called ‚Äúperpendicular paramagnetic bonding mechanism‚Äù as well as on the influence of electron correlation on total and binding energies. Additionally, the performance of functionals in current density functional theory is discussed. As exact results are completely unknown, highly accurate benchmarks are essential to assess the quality of density functional theory results. Finally, an outlook on future theoretical developments is given.},
