\section{Introduction}
Studies in exotic environments is always a curious matter in science, and one of them is recently seen to be the molecules in strong magnetic fields. In extreme magnetic fields one might observe that unbound states of molecules are found to be bonding. This kind of bonding is called Paramagnetic Perpendicular bonding mechanism \cite{langeParamagneticBondingMechanism2012}. Due to the extreme magnetic field correlation\cite{langeParamagneticBondingMechanism2012} does not play a strong part so there is a hartree-fock (HF) multiresolution code present in madness library called znemo\cite{bischoffStructureMathrmMolecule2020}. If one is measuring something analytical spectra or something of that sort then one might need to consider treating with post-HF methods \cite{stopkowiczPerspectiveCoupledCluster2018}.
