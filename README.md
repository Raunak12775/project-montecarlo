## Description

We try to find $He_3$ and $He_2$ structures in strong magnetic field by sampling. The process of sampling that we use is classical montecarlo algorithm specifically Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with simulated annealing technique. The model in the algorithm that we use for sampling is a module from madness code called [znemo](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.101.053413) to compute the energy for probabilistic decision making. We use Mersenne-Twister engine to generate the random numbers for distorting the geometry.
